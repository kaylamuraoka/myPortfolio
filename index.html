          <p>My name is Kayla Muraoka, a driven and creative Digital Website Merchandiser with an eye for aesthetics, strong retail insights, business acumen, and a deep passion for bringing the customer online shopping experience to life through compelling digital storytelling. I am highly skilled in analyzing customer shopping behavior to find the optimal product placement, navigation filters and photography strategy to increase customer engagement, conversion and sales. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As a Digital Website Merchandiser at Old Navy, I am responsible for managing Girl's swimwear, activewear, and fleece throughout the entire product lifecycle, from concept to customer. My department contributes close to 1/3rd of the division's online revenue. My strength is in analyzing customer behavior, macro-economic trends, business performance, and web analytics to identify strategic product opportunities that drive digital growth and that align with the company goals. Additionally, I am instrumental in collaborating cross-functionally with brand marketing, production, copywriting, photography, and design teams to drive engagement, conversion rate, and traffic, using the site experience as a key lever in building and maintaining brand awareness/loyalty. I enjoy providing creative styling direction to photography, using product placement, promotional pricing, faceted navigation, and sort order to improve the overall user experience on oldnavy.com.</p>

          <p>In my current role, I have been responsible for optimizing product placement and creating visual displays that engage customers and drive sales. Through this work, I have discovered a passion for understanding customer behavior and preferences, and for using creative and strategic marketing tactics to meet their needs. I am drawn to marketing because of its constantly evolving nature. In today's digital age, marketing strategies are changing rapidly, and it is essential for marketers to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. I am excited about the prospect of working in an industry that is constantly evolving and offers opportunities for continuous learning and growth. While I do not have formal experience in marketing, I am confident in my ability to adapt to new challenges and to leverage my existing skills to succeed in this field.
          </p>

          <p>I am a creative thinker and an agile problem solver with a technical background in information systems. I have experience translating both quantitative and qualitative data into actionable solutions that align with business and financial objectives. My managers have praised my attention to detail and my ability to be an effective, driven, and accountable employee. I strongly believe that my positive attitude, work ethic, and eagerness to learn, combined with my technical skill set, international experience, and communication skills make me a versatile candidate.
